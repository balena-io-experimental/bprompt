# bprompt

A Small but Usefulâ„¢ utility to switch between different Balena credentials and API endpoints.  Still a WIP.

# Building

Build with go:

```
go build
```

# Usage

- `bprompt -print`: Print a list of accounts that it knows about

- `bprompt -show`: Show the current state of your token and API endpoint

- `bprompt -switch`: Switch to one of those accounts.  This is meant
  to:
  
  - symlink `~/.balena/token` to `~/.balena/token.[account name]`
  
  - update the API endpoint in `~/.balenarc`
  
  **Note:** These features are not done yet.
  
- `bprompt -prompt`: Print out a string that can be incorporated into
  your shell prompt.  In Bash, the idea is that you'd add something
  like this to your `.bashrc`:
  
```
PROMPT_COMMAND='export BALENA_REMINDER=$(path/to/bprompt -prompt)'
PS1="$BALENA_REMINDER \d \t $"
```

and then have a nice visual reminder of the account you're using:

# Future improvements

- Add configuration file for paths and tokens
